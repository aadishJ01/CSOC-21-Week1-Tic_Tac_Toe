# Tic Tac Toe Game
  Created a Tic Tac Toe Game

## HOW TO PLAY
  1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
  2. If, you are X, your friend (or the computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
  3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
  4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
